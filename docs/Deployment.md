### Project Deployment

#### Overview

This section outlines the steps and requirements for deploying the Project Management API. The deployment process includes setting up the environment, configuring the application, and running the application in a production environment. The project can be deployed using Docker for containerization or directly on a server.

#### Deployment Options

1. **Docker**: Containerize the application using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.
2. **Direct Deployment**: Deploy the application directly on a server without using Docker.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on the server.
2. **Docker**: If using Docker, ensure Docker is installed and configured on the server.
3. **Environment Variables**: Set up the necessary environment variables for configuration.

#### Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables for configuration. An example configuration is provided in the `.env.example` file. You can create a `.env` file based on this example.

**Example `.env` File**

```example
APP_ENV=prod
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./project_management.db
```

#### Docker Deployment

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```sh
   docker build -t project-management-api .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

   ```sh
   docker run --env-file app/.env -p 8000:8000 project-management-api
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

#### Direct Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have installed all the dependencies listed in the

requirements.txt

file.
`sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    `

2. **Run Database Migrations**:

   - Ensure the database is set up and migrations are applied (if any).

3. **Run the Application**:

   - Use Uvicorn to serve the FastAPI application.

   ```sh
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

4. **Configure a Process Manager**:
   - Use a process manager like `systemd`, `supervisord`, or `pm2` to manage the application process and ensure it runs continuously.

**Example `systemd` Service File**:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Project Management API
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_user
Group=your_group
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/project
ExecStart=/path/to/your/venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Navigate to `http://your_server_ip:8000` to view the application.

#### Additional Configuration

1. **HTTPS**:
   - Configure HTTPS using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy.
   - Obtain an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt.

**Example Nginx Configuration**:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

2. **Environment-Specific Configurations**:
   - Use different environment variables for development, staging, and production environments.
   - Ensure sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, API keys) is stored securely.

#### Summary

This documentation provides an overview of the deployment process for the Project Management API. It includes steps for deploying the application using Docker or directly on a server, setting up environment variables, configuring HTTPS, and managing the application process. By following these steps, you can ensure a smooth and secure deployment of the application. For more details, refer to the source code and the project documentation files, including the README.md file.
